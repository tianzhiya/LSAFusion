# LSAFusion
Code of LSAFusion:It is an infrared and visible light image fusion algorithm specifically designed for low-light environments.
## Tips:<br>
Due to file size issues, the training set has been removed from the code and the MSRS dataset can be downloaded here:https://github.com/Linfeng-Tang/MSRS
Place the downloaded training dataset under: MSRS/ path.

## To Train
Run "**python trainEnlightFusion.py**" to train the model.
The training data are selected from the MSRS dataset. 

## To Test
Please download the pre-trained model from the link https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qfOx5VlPGg9iB8d7m5puFA?pwd=b593  using the extraction code b593. After downloading, perform the testing with the model. Subsequently, place the downloaded model file in the directory /model/Fusion/.

Run "**python TestEnlightFusion.py**" to test the model.
The images generated by the test will be placed under the lianHeXuLian/EnlightOut/MSRSFusion path.

## Result 
The results of our fusion testing on the MSRS dataset, which you can download here: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VJmGOVakBuAZT9SyZcmH9Halm7Ngonx9/view?usp=sharing);
